  abstract  = "We present a new graph compressor that detects repeating substructures and represents them by grammar rules. We show that for a large number of graphs the compressor obtains smaller representations than other approaches. For RDF graphs and version graphs it outperforms the best known previous methods. Specific queries such as reachability between two nodes, can be evaluated in linear time over the grammar, thus allowing speed-ups proportional to the compression ratio.",
